Together, the leaders decide on a Product Leadership team. Unknown to them, some of the Leaders intend to fail the company and join a competitor. These traitors may fail a Product if they are made a part of the Product Team. To thwart the traitors, the Leaders must successfully launch 3 Products. If the Traitors manage to fail 3 products, the company goes bankrupt and the Leaders lose. The Leaders are not told the identity of the traitors.
